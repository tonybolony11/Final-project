            <h2>I am a man of many shades</h2>
            <p>Hey my name is Tony, a little about me is that i grew up in mexico for about 11 years then permanently moved to Fresno afterwards, so naturally spanish is my first language and have yet to master English lol but who has right?. I grew up in Fresno and in late 2015 left on a journey that i couldnt of ever imagined,nothing was planned everything kind of happened naturally and just went with the flow. As of octobeer 2019 i moved back to fresno heard about this crazy cool place Bitwise and geekwise academy and i told myself to give it a go. All my time has been focused on learning as much as i can on this field in tech so eventually maybe i can someday be working in the field remotely and continue to travel in a more comfortable way. </p>
            <p>Ive lived in 4 countries 3 states and evey place has brought me great teachings that have made me grow into the person I currently am. My passions besides traveling are beach volleyball,hiking,and making connections with people. Yosemite National Park has been home for me since late 2015 and i hold much love for that sacred place you can find me most summers there living offgrid making my own fires at night and being kind to other human beings.This is my blog check it out,</p></div>
